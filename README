Proclaunch is a super simple pure-perl process management framework. It takes two command line arguments: a place to write it's pidfile and a directory full of profiles. A profile is a directory that contains these special files:

- pid_file = contains the path to the file where run will place it's pid
- run = an executable that will daemonize itself and write it's pid to the path in pid_file
- restart = an empty file whose presence tells proclaunch to restart run if it dies.
